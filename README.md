# weighted-network-find-algorithm


##What is weighted network find algorithm
It is a algorithm to process the network data ,after processing the data will be divide to several communities(a community have several nodes and edges),and the algorithm also get the set of overlapping nodes(just means the nodes can be included in different communities)

##about algorithm
the algorithm is based on python
use networkx.pandas.numpy.math.collections

##how to assess the algorithm
I will give some other compared algorithm like cpm,conga,lfm and so on and get their Modularity to compare their effect.
